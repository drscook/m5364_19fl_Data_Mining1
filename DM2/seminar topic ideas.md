Seminar topic ideas

This is just a starting point of some things I know I want to learn more about.  Under most topics, I have listed a few tools that I know about already, but I'm guessing that there are new & improved options.  There are MANY more legitiamte topics - please propose them.


- NLP
  - regex
  - Word embeddings
    - Word2Vec
- out-of-core datasets & delayed operations
  - Dask
  - Vaex
- Topological Data Anaylsis
- Bayesian Statistics/Probabilitistic programming
  - PyMC3
  - Stan
  - TensorFlow Probability
  - PyTorch
- Dashboards & User Interfaces
  - Voila (your Jupyter notebooks becomes a stand alone app)
  - Tableau
- Enhanced random forests (GradientBoost, XGBoost, lightgbm, catboost)
- Extracting data from the web
  - Beautiful soup
  - Selenium
  - API's (Twitter, Facebook, etc)
- GPU integration
  - NVIDIA Rapids
- Visualization
  - This is so broad, you should select a subset of tools and run it by me
- Cold Start Problem & solutions
- Strategies for selecting ANN hyperparameters (archicture, activation functions, etc)
- AutoML
  
  
possible future topics:
- GANS
- AutoEncoders
