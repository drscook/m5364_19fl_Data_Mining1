- NLP
  - regex
  - Word embeddings
    - Word2Vec
- out-of-core datasets & delayed operations
  - Dask
  - Vaex
- Topological Data Anaylsis
- Bayesian Statistics/Probabilitistic programming
  - PyMC3
  - Stan
  - TensorFlow Probability
- Dashboards & User Interfaces
  - Voila (your Jupyter notebooks becomes a stand alone app)
  - Tableau
- Enhanced random forests (GradientBoost, XGBoost, lightgbm, catboost)
- Extracting data from the web
  - Beautiful soup
  - Selenium
  - API's (Twitter, Facebook, etc)
- GPU integration
