Following Fast.AI lesson 2, build a classifier to distinguish the following Minecraft mobs
- skeleton
- zombie

Submit:
- folder called "images" with subfolders for each mob
- .ipynb file containing
- On top - the confusion matrix for your best model
- code that produced your best model
- discussion of the various things you tried along the way and what you learned from them
