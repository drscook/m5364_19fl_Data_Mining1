Following Fast.AI lesson 2, build a classifier to distinguish the following Minecraft mobs
- skeleton
- zombie
- husk
- creeper
- slime

Please follow Jeremy's instrutions to obtain images using google images.  Get at least 50 images for each mob (I encourage you to get more).  Try the various techniques he shows in the video to optimize your model.

Submit:
- folder called "images" with subfolders for each mob
- .ipynb file containing
- Executive summary of your best model
  - confusion matrix
  - "plot top losses"
- code that produced your best model
- discussion of the various things you tried along the way and what you learned from them
