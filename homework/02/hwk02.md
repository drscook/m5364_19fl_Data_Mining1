Goal: Build foundational Python knowledge.  There's a wide range Python experience among you all; these reading/reflections are intended to get us all on the same page.

- Read all sections of https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython except .....
- Create your googe drive folder where you will submit hwk.  Share it with me.
- Submit at least 3 questions or comments for potential in class discussion into that folder.  Examples:
  - Something you don't understand and want clarification
  - Errors you encountered (and hopefully corrected)
  - Comments you think will help someone else who is learning this for the first time.  (Keep these short are basic.  This is a WhirlWind Tour.  We are intentionally selecting only the most essential core things.  Over time, we will meet a lot of ways to accomplish these same tasks more easily and with more features; don't go into this here).
 
 
If you are a Python novice, this is your chance to get grounded.  Don't worry if your questions seem too simple or silly.  It can be very frustrating to get started because tutorials often forget about some really early and basic frustrations.  Don't be concerned you look dumb - we've all gone through that stage.  Just remember to be kind and encouraging when the table flips and you are the experienced one helping a novice.

If you are an experience Python user, this is *NOT* your chance to show off or try to impress me.  This is your chance to try to help someone.  Try to remember how frustating and confusing even little problems feel when you first try something new and channel that emotion into making life better for a classmate.  If you want to impress me, that's how to do it.
