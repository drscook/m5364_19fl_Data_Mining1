This is under construction, but fairly well developed

- Form groups of 3 or 4.
- Your group will work from a common data set, but do different projects with it.
- Work together to identify, obtain, clean, and the data and discuss questions and potential data science approaches.  Then you will work separately on the analysis & report.
- You are encouraged to discuss your projects with each other to get ideas and solve problems.  But you are responsible for your own final product.
- Submissions:
  - Oral: 10 minute talk (to be scheduled sometime 12/2-12/12)
  - Written: Due 12/13
  - Except for Bishwas - your stuff is due 12/10 b/c graduating student grades are due earlier
- Requirements
  - Must use at least three supervised learning algorithms and compare performance
    - Don't use a decision tree (use a random forests instead)
  - Must must appropriate cross-validation
  - Must be thoroughly evaluated using appropriate performance metrics (accuracy, confusion matrices, cost matrices/functions, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F_beta, ROC, AUR, etc)
  - Must identify and tune hyperparameters
  - Clearly describe all major decisions you had to make (ex: imputation method, performance metric, feature engineering, etc)
  - Must screen for and correct poorly conditioned data (severe bias, missing data, anomalies such as incorrectly entered data, etc)

- Strong preferences (exceptions must receive my explicit approval)
  - categorical target variable(s)
    - because we focused mainly on classifiers in first semester
    - However, many continuous target variables can be converted into categorical variables by binning (ex: high, med, low)
  - high quality graphics
